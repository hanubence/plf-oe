## Introduction
Welcome to the project documentation for a Bachelor's thesis on pasture-based livestock farming at Ã“buda University.

In this study, we explore the domain of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), leveraging IoT technologies to advance livestock farming methodologies and practices.

The main objective of this project is to:

1. Design and implement an IoT device that is capable of reliable data collection even in remote locations
2. Utilize the collected data with artificial intelligence, thus hoping to provide business value to farmers.
